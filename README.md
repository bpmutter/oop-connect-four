# OOP Connect Four

Made as part of the curriculum of [App Academy ](https://www.appacademy.io/), pair programmed with [Marco Serrano](https://github.com/serranomarco/). March 2020.

## Core Objective: Practice OOP principles
The primary focus of this project was to practice with the core principles of [object oriented programming](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html) (OOP). All core game logic was encapsulated in the `Game.js` file, where it was called and rendered from the `connect-four.js` file. We made extensive using of the single-responsibility principle, one of the core tenets of the [SOLID](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) principles of OOP design.
